Video Content Analyzer






This project is a comprehensive tool that allows users to download a video from YouTube, extract frames and audio, transcribe the audio into text, and analyze both the video frames and the audio text using AI models to provide a summary of the content. The summaries are focused on programming languages and concepts.
